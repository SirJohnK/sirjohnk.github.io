Using Zebra Scanners with non Zebra devices on Android or iOS? Then maybe this enhanced .NET MAUI version of the Zebra Scanner SDK for Xamarin/MAUI is for you.

## Background
A couple of years ago, when upgrading a [Xamarin](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/xamarin) application to [.NET MAUI](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/maui), the Zebra [Scanner Xamarin Wrapper (Android and iOS)](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/support-downloads/software/scanner-software/xamarin-wrapper-for-scanner-sdk-for-android-and-ios.html) was not yet migrated to [.NET MAUI](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/maui), so this library was created. Zebra have since then released the [.NET MAUI Wrapper for Scanner SDK (iOS and Android)](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/support-downloads/software/scanner-software/net-maui-wrapper.html) package. That package is not distributed as a common NuGet package and is not updated in the same pace as the native Android/iOS libraries, therefore this library is still maintained as a convenient complement.

## Library
The library is available both as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ZebraScannerSDK.Maui) and a [MIT licensed repository at GitHub](https://github.com/SirJohnK/ZebraScannerSDK.Maui).

|Name|Nuget|GitHub
| ------------------- | :------------------: | :------------------: |
|ZebraScannerSDK.Maui|[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/ZebraScannerSDK.Maui)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ZebraScannerSDK.Maui/)|[![GitHub Release Date](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/sirjohnk/ZebraScannerSDK.Maui)](https://github.com/SirJohnK/ZebraScannerSDK.Maui)|


## What's included?
Compared to the original solution we have some enhanced and added features:
- One easy to use NuGet package.
- Easy setup with service collection extension.
- New `IScannerSDK` interface registered for constructor injection with DI.
- New sample app.

## Setup
Use the `AddZebraScannerSDK` service collection extension method for library configuration.
```csharp
var builder = MauiApp.CreateBuilder();
builder
    .UseMauiApp<App>()
    .ConfigureFonts(fonts =>
    {
        fonts.AddFont("OpenSans-Regular.ttf", "OpenSansRegular");
        fonts.AddFont("OpenSans-Semibold.ttf", "OpenSansSemibold");
    })

    //Add Services
    builder.Services.AddZebraScannerSDK();
```
For further documentation, see the [Official Zebra Resources](#official-zebra-resources) or the [Sample application](#sample).

## Sample
Look at the [Sample project](https://github.com/SirJohnK/ZebraScannerSDK.Maui/tree/main/ZebraScannerSDK.Maui.Sample) for a example of how to use this library in an .NET MAUI application.
