I have been a fan of the Localization helpers and extensions in the [Xamarin Community Toolkit](https://github.com/xamarin/XamarinCommunityToolkit) and have been using this in my Xamarin projects. Since moving to [.NET MAUI](https://github.com/dotnet/maui), I hoped for this to be part of the [MAUI Community Toolkit](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Maui). For good reasons the team has decided not to include this in MCT and a [proposal](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/dotnet/issues/312) is issued in the [.NET Community Toolkit](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/dotnet). But the XCT solution have dependencies to the Xamarin `IMarkupExtension` interface and the XCT `WeakEventManager` helper class, which makes it tricky to port to a non MAUI library. So until we have a official solution, or anyway is added to MCT, I decided to create a .NET MAUI library for this called *LocalizationResourceManager.Maui*!

Big shoutout to the original authors, [Charlin Agramonte](https://github.com/Char0394), [Brandon Minnick](https://github.com/brminnick), [Maksym Koshovyi](https://github.com/maxkoshevoi) and the entire [Xamarin Community Toolkit Team](https://github.com/xamarin/XamarinCommunityToolkit/graphs/contributors)!

## Library
The library is available both as a [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LocalizationResourceManager.Maui/) and a [MIT licensed repository at GitHub](https://github.com/SirJohnK/LocalizationResourceManager.Maui).

|Name|Nuget|GitHub
| ------------------- | :------------------: | :------------------: |
|LocalizationResourceManager.Maui|[![NuGet](https://buildstats.info/nuget/LocalizationResourceManager.Maui?includePreReleases=true)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LocalizationResourceManager.Maui/)|[![GitHub Release Date](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/sirjohnk/LocalizationResourceManager.Maui)](https://github.com/SirJohnK/LocalizationResourceManager.Maui)|

Compared to the original solution we have some enhanced and added features:
- Easy setup with builder pattern extension
- Supports multiple Resource managers
- Supports storing and restoring of the latest set culture
- New `ILocalizationResourceManager` interface registered for constructor injection with DI
- Stores current Default / System culture
- Uses the WeakEventHandler (.NET MAUI)

For localized texts used in XAML and/or code behind, we still have:
- TranslateExtension (XAML Markup Extension)
- LocalizedString (Track Culture Change in code behind)

## Preparations
To use this library, there are some preperations you need to do in your .NET MAUI project/application:
- Set the `Assembly neutral language` to your default language.<br>
(In project properties screen or directly in the project file!)<br>

```csharp
<NeutralLanguage>en</NeutralLanguage>
```

- Create/Add a `Resources File` (resx) with the Resources Files Template for your default language. e.g. **AppResources.resx**
- Create/Add a `Resources File` (resx) for each additional language you want to support. e.g. **AppResources-fr.rex** for French<br>(Use same name as default file and add language code. [List of all Language codes](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb964664.aspx))

## Easy setup
As many .NET MAUI libraries, I use the builder pattern for easy configuration. To setup the library, you use the `UseLocalizationResourceManager` extension method with the `ILocalizationSettings` settings methods for custom configuration.
```csharp
var builder = MauiApp.CreateBuilder();
builder
    .UseMauiApp<App>()
    .ConfigureFonts(fonts =>
    {
        fonts.AddFont("OpenSans-Regular.ttf", "OpenSansRegular");
        fonts.AddFont("OpenSans-Semibold.ttf", "OpenSansSemibold");
    })
    .UseLocalizationResourceManager(settings =>
    {
        settings.AddResource(AppResources.ResourceManager);
        settings.RestoreLatestCulture(true);
    });
```
Settings contains 3 methods for configuration:
- AddResource
- InitialCulture
- RestoreLatestCulture

### AddResource
Used to add one or more Resource Managers. e.g. AppResources.ResourceManager, SpecialResources.ResourceManager etc.

**Note**: All resource libraries will be searched in the order they were added, until resource is found!
### InitialCulture
Set the initial/startup culture used for application. e.g. new CultureInfo("fr")

**Default**: Current System Culture
### RestoreLatestCulture
Flag indicating if latest set culture should be restored on application startup.

**Default**: false

**Note**: This setting, if set to true, will override the InitalCulture setting!
