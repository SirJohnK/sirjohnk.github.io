I have been a fan of the Localization helpers and extensions in the [Xamarin Community Toolkit](https://github.com/xamarin/XamarinCommunityToolkit) and have been using this in my Xamarin projects. Since moving to [.NET MAUI](https://github.com/dotnet/maui), I hoped for this to be part of the [MAUI Community Toolkit](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Maui). For good reasons the team has decided not to include this in MCT and a [proposal](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/dotnet/issues/312) is issued in the [.NET Community Toolkit](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/dotnet). But the XCT solution have dependencies to the Xamarin `IMarkupExtension` interface and the XCT `WeakEventManager` helper class, which makes it tricky to port to a non MAUI library. So until we have a official solution, or anyway is added to MCT, I decided to create a .NET MAUI library for this called *LocalizationResourceManager.Maui*!
